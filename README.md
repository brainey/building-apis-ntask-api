Example of building a service API with Node JS and express.

This project follows my progress of working through the book [Building APIs with Node.js](http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484224410#otherversion=9781484224427) by Caio Ribeiro Pereira.
Most of the code here comes from the chapters in that book.

So far, my improvements have been:
* Getting port number from environment variable PORT
* Building upon example of config_test.js, added config_development.js and config_production.js.
* Moved port number to params in config_<NODE_ENV>.js
* Made storage name of the database specific to each NODE_ENV {test, development, production} so as to destroy the production DB during either tests or development.
* Modified the beforeEach() of the tests to completely reinitialize the database each time
* Fixed typo in APIDoc stuff for Users (book had it as Tasks)

Problems:
* .expect(200) seems mostly useless in that it doesn't throw an error. Research so far points to a problem of waiting for the response and the use of Promises versus callbacks. More research is needed here to come up with a better solution. For now, added shoulds inside the end() to make sure that the status is 200 (OK) before digging into the responses.

Todo:
* create directories such as public for apidoc and possibly logs (although I think it gets created automatically by winston).
